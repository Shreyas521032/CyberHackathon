Deepfake vs Real Image Dataset

📌 Overview

The Deepfake vs Real Image Dataset is a collection of manipulated and real human face images, intended for deepfake detection research 
and machine learning applications. The dataset contains real human face images and synthetically generated or manipulated faces created 
using various deepfake techniques.

The primary goal of this dataset is to enable the development of robust deepfake detection models, aiding in identifying synthetic media
and improving security against misinformation and identity fraud.

📂 Dataset Composition

This dataset consists of high-quality face images in JPEG format with a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels. The images are divided into two 
categories:

🟢 Real Images: Authentic human face images.

🔴 Deepfake Images: Faces generated using AI-based synthesis techniques or digital manipulation.

🛠 Data Source & Processing

The dataset originates from Zenodo.

The images have been preprocessed and curated to maximize efficiency for deepfake detection tasks.

The dataset is structured to provide a balanced distribution of real and fake images, ensuring effective training for classification models.

🔎 Applications

This dataset is useful for:

🧠 Deepfake Detection: Training AI models to distinguish real vs. fake images.

🎭 Synthetic Media Analysis: Understanding patterns in AI-generated facial images.

🔬 Computer Vision Research: Improving robustness of face recognition models.

🚀 Cybersecurity & Misinformation Prevention: Identifying fake identities in social media and media industries.

⚠️ Ethical Considerations

While this dataset aids in deepfake detection, it should be used responsibly to ensure ethical AI practices. Misuse of deepfake detection 
technology can raise privacy concerns and ethical dilemmas regarding digital identity verification.
